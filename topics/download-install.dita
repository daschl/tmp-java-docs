	<title>Installing the Couchbase Java SDK</title>
	<conbody>
		<p>At a minimum, Java 6 is required, but any newer version is also supported (including the newly released Java 8).</p>
		<p>Currently, the Java SDK is in a beta release state, so you need to include the Couchbase Maven
			Repository if you want to pull it in automatically. Here is a typical
				<filepath>pom.xml</filepath> that you can copy and paste into your Java project:</p>
		<codeblock outputclass="language-xml"><![CDATA[<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
]]></codeblock>

		<p>You can also download an archive that has all JARs and dependencies included, but in general
			using a package manager is strongly recommended.</p>
		<p>If you import the dependency, the following transitive dependencies will also be added:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><xref href="https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-jvm-core" format="html" scope="external"
					>core-io</xref>: our internal core library, which abstracts lots of
				Couchbase-specific behavior in a language neutral way.</li>
			<li><xref href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava" format="html" scope="external">RxJava</xref>: a foundational library to build reactive and asynchronous applications.</li>
		</ul>
